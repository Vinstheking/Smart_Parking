# Car Damage Detection App

## Overview
The **Car Damage Detection App** is an AI-powered application that identifies and classifies vehicle damages from images.  
Built using **ResNet50** for transfer learning, the system is trained on third-quarter front and rear views of cars.  
Users can simply drag and drop an image into the app to instantly get the predicted damage category.  

This project can be used for:
- **Insurance claim processing**
- **Repair assessments**
- **Automated vehicle inspections**

## Features# Smart Parking Management System

## Overview

The Smart Parking Management System is an IoT-based project designed to efficiently monitor and manage parking lot occupancy. It utilizes ESP32 microcontrollers and IR sensors to detect slot availability, with a user-friendly web interface for interaction. The project includes distinct functionalities for owners and users, ensuring a seamless parking experience.

## Features

### Owner Portal:

* **Update Slot Status:** Owners can manually mark slots as occupied, free, or under construction.
* **View Vehicle Logs:** A detailed history of all parked vehicles.

### User Portal:

* **Available Slots Overview:** Displays the current availability of parking slots.
* **Parking History:** Shows the user's past parking activities.
* **Payment Summary:** Users can view unpaid entries and update them as paid via the "Pay Now" button.

### Dashboard Tabs:

1. **Home:** Displays the parking lot layout.
2. **History:** Shows parking logs with details like:

   * In Time
   * Out Time
   * Duration
   * Status (Paid/Unpaid)
   * Amount (calculated at â‚¹50/hour).
3. **Payment History:** Displays past paid entries.

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Flask
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Database:** SQLite
* **IoT Components:**

  * ESP32 microcontrollers
  * IR sensors for slot occupancy detection
* **Communication Protocol:** MQTT

## System Architecture

1. **Hardware Layer:**

   * IR sensors detect slot occupancy.
   * ESP32 processes sensor data and communicates via MQTT.
2. **Backend:**

   * Flask handles user authentication, slot updates, and log management.
3. **Frontend:**

   * A responsive web interface for owners and users.
4. **Database:**

   * SQL stores user data, slot statuses, and transaction logs.
